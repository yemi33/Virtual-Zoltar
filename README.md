# Virtual-Zoltar

## Introduction
Welcome to the Virtual Zoltar Program where you can get psychic reads for all aspects of your life. This was a project created in Freshman year of College as part of the Introduction to Computer Science course. It is my very first computer program! :)

## Example Run
1. 

```Your cards are:  The_Hermit , The_Emperor and Wheel_of_Fortune

Your past holds:  
 The Hermit represents solitude. If you are alone currently, expect things to stay this way, or perhaps new relationships will feel empty and loveless. If you are currently in a relationship, you will soon feel unfulfilled or withdrawn, or the relationship will come to an end and your solitude will last for an extended period of time. Your solitude is not necessarily a negative thing but will allow you to be introspective and find yourself. 

Your present holds:  
 The Emperor represents strength, control, and masculinity. Either a man will soon enter your life in a romantic way or a romantic partner will take control and show strength in your relationship. 

Your future holds:  
 The Wheel of Fortune represents constant change and the coming of good fortune. You will either find a new, very compatible partner or you will a find new compatibility in your current relationship. Prepare for spontaneity and unpredictability in this new side of your relationship.
